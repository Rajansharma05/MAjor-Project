Machine learning algorithms make a significant contribution to design and develop computer aided diagnosis systems . The work's overarching goal is to assist academics and practitioners in selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm in healthcare databases. Various studies have indicated that machine learning algorithms work best in detecting and identifications of several diseases in healthcare dataset.The daya by day machine learning algorithms are used by the various researchers and scholars to improve the performance of the computer aided diagnosis system.
In this study we have proposed.we have applied SVM models on the dataset to
classify the diseases classified into two categories benign and malignant .
Till we have applied now the svm model has obtained the performance result 96%.
